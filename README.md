# 🏢 Agent Office

**A 3D office your team shares with its coding agents.**

Sit **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, **Grok**, **Muse** and **DeepSeek Harness** workers at desks, watch each one's terminal on the laptop in front of it,
and jump into any of them together. Every GitHub repo is a floor of the building. The HUD’s **Limits** panel shows Claude plan usage and one shared Codex account snapshot, using the latest report from any floor.

## What it is

- **A floor per project.** Ride the elevator, pick one of your GitHub repos, and the office clones it and opens a floor for it. Every worker, board and queue on that floor works in that checkout.
- **Workers at desks.** Walk up to an empty desk, press **E**, and pick Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok, Muse or DeepSeek Harness. The agent's live terminal shows on its laptop, and anyone can open it and type. **Shift + 1–9 / 0** opens a terminal in **WORKERS** panel order (0 is tenth); hold Shift to see the numbered tip, which clears on release or when focus moves away from the office controls.
- **You can see who needs you.** A worker that needs input or has finished jumps up and down and dings. Press **N** to go straight to the one that has waited longest.
- **From your phone, too.** `/lite` is the office in 2D: every worker and what it's waiting on, its terminal with the keys a phone keyboard lacks, and the boards. The 3D office offers it on a phone or a slow computer.
- **GitHub on the walls.** Issues and pull requests hang on cork boards. Hand an issue to a worker, queue tasks, give a worker its own git worktree and open its PR with one key (if one gets deleted behind the office's back, the worker waits at its desk until you rebuild it). One task can span several projects: the worker gets a worktree of each, and a PR in each that links the others.
- **Agents that manage agents.** Every worker can list, hire, message and send home the others, through an `agent-office` MCP server (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) or the `office-workers` command. Ask one to "send everyone whose PR merged home" and it does, deleting their worktrees and branches unless they hold unpushed work.
- **Together.** Voice, chat, screen sharing on the lounge TV and a shared whiteboard.

- **Other maps.** Turn the whole building into a castle: sit on a throne of iron blades while your workers line up before you when they're done, send new ones off through the Hand of the King, and watch their beards grow long and grey as they toil. Send one home and the Kingsguard runs up from the dungeon, marches it down the stairs and throws it in a cell, where it starves, dies and rots down to a skeleton. Or make a map of your own, with its own way of seeing workers off in JSON ([docs/maps.md](docs/maps.md)).

There's a lot more (a rooftop bar, an office dog, an arcade, supercars in the garage to drive round a scenic loop past a farm, pines, mountains and a beach): see [docs/features.md](docs/features.md).

## Requirements

On the machine that runs the office:

- **Node.js 20+**
- At least one agent CLI, signed in as the user that runs the office: **Claude Code** (`claude`), **Codex** (`codex`), **OpenCode** (`opencode`), **Grok** (`grok`), **Muse** (`muse`) or **DeepSeek Harness** (`dsh`). With [accounts](#add-users), everyone can sign in to their own Claude from the office instead.
- **git**, and the **GitHub CLI** (`gh auth login`) for cloning repos and the issue and PR boards

## Run locally

Install the latest release and start the office:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office/main/install.sh | bash
```

On Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This puts an `agent-office` command on your PATH, so next time just run `agent-office`. Run the install line again to update. The installer's settings (a particular release, install without starting) are listed at the top of [`install.sh`](install.sh) and [`install.ps1`](install.ps1).

The first time it starts, it walks you through setting up, right in the terminal:

1. **Where to clone your projects.** It suggests a code folder you already have (`~/Workspace`, `~/code`…), else `~/agent-office`. Each project goes in `<folder>/<owner>/<repo>`.
2. **GitHub.** If the GitHub CLI isn't signed in, it offers to run `gh auth login` for you.
3. **Your first project.** Pick one of your repos by number, or type `owner/name`, and the office clones it as the first floor.

Press Enter to skip a step: the elevator in the office asks for your first project too. Then the office opens in your browser, **already signed in**, with a link that works once. The terminal also prints the office password, for signing in from another browser (it's saved in `~/agent-office/.agent-office/config.json`).

Walk to an empty desk, press **E** and hire a worker.

Common options:

```bash
agent-office ~/code/my-project              # use a project you already have as the first floor
agent-office --password 'correct horse'     # choose the password
agent-office --port 4700
agent-office --agent grok                   # default agent: claude, codex, opencode, grok, muse or dsh
agent-office --no-open                      # print the sign-in link instead of opening a browser
agent-office setup                          # the first-start walkthrough again (office stopped)
```

Every option is in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md). Choosing models and providers per worker, including for the agents on the wall, is in [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

To run it from a clone instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
npm install          # also builds the client and server
npm install -g .     # puts `agent-office` on your PATH
agent-office
```

> Only your computer can reach the office: it listens on `127.0.0.1`. `--host 0.0.0.0` lets your network in, but over plain http, where voice and screen sharing don't work. To share the office with a team, put it on a server: [AWS](#deploy-to-aws-ec2), [Azure](#deploy-to-azure), [Railway](#deploy-to-railway), [Fly.io](#deploy-to-flyio), [Dokploy](#deploy-to-dokploy) or [any Ubuntu or Debian machine](#deploy-to-any-ubuntu-or-debian-server).

## Deploy to AWS (EC2)

One script, using only the AWS CLI. You need the **AWS CLI signed in** (`aws configure` or `aws sso login`), `ssh`, `curl` and a clone of this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
deploy/aws.sh up --project your-org/your-repo --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

In about two minutes, `up`:

1. Launches a **t3.xlarge** (4 vCPU, 16 GiB) Ubuntu 24.04 instance with a 50 GiB disk and a fixed Elastic IP.
2. Creates a security group that opens **only SSH, only to your IP**. The office listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` on the machine and is never on the internet. Everyone reaches it through an SSH tunnel, so there are no certificates to manage, and voice and screen sharing work.
3. Runs [`deploy/provision.sh`](deploy/provision.sh) on it: Node 22, git, the GitHub CLI, Claude Code and the office, under systemd, so it comes back after a crash or reboot and workers keep running through a restart.
4. Opens a tunnel and your browser at http://localhost:4600. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.**

`--project` is optional: it clones that repo as the first floor. Leave it out and pick projects in the elevator.

**Signing in the agents.** `--claude-token` uses your Claude subscription; `--anthropic-api-key <key>` uses an API key instead. Leave both out and run `/login` in the first worker's terminal. Codex and OpenCode aren't installed by the script: `deploy/aws.sh ssh` and install them yourself.

**GitHub.** Your local `gh auth token` is copied to the machine so the office can clone private repos, show the boards and push PRs. Anyone in the office can use it, so pass `--github-token <fine-grained token>` or `--no-github-token` to limit that.

**On Tailscale, no tunnels.** If your team uses [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), add `--tailscale`:

```bash
deploy/aws.sh up --tailscale --project your-org/your-repo --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

The machine joins your tailnet, and Tailscale Serve puts the office on `https://agent-office.<your-tailnet>.ts.net` with a real certificate. Anyone on your tailnet just opens that link: no terminal to keep open, no SSH keys, no IPs to allow, and voice and screen sharing work. `up` opens Tailscale's page to add the machine (or pass `--tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-…`) and, the first time, the page that turns on HTTPS for your tailnet. SSH stays open to your IP only, for `deploy/aws.sh` itself. More in [docs/aws.md](docs/aws.md#tailscale).

Day to day:

```bash
deploy/aws.sh open                # tunnel + open the office (Ctrl-C closes the tunnel)
deploy/aws.sh status              # machine, address, is the office up, who's invited
deploy/aws.sh logs                # follow the office's logs
deploy/aws.sh ssh                 # a shell on the machine
deploy/aws.sh update              # install the latest agent-office and restart
deploy/aws.sh resize t3.2xlarge   # bigger or smaller machine, same address
deploy/aws.sh pause               # stop the machine; only the disk and IP are billed
deploy/aws.sh resume              # start it again and open it
deploy/aws.sh destroy             # delete everything it created (asks first)
```

You can also upgrade from inside the office: **☰ → ⬆️ Upgrade the office**. Other flags (`--region`, `--instance-type`, `--disk`, `--name` for several offices) are in `deploy/aws.sh help`, and the details are in [docs/aws.md](docs/aws.md).

## Deploy to Azure

The same thing on an Azure VM, using only the Azure CLI. You need the **Azure CLI signed in** (`az login`), `ssh`, `curl` and a clone of this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
deploy/azure.sh up --project your-org/your-repo --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

`up` puts everything in a resource group of its own, `agent-office`, and launches a **Standard_D4as_v5** VM (4 vCPU and 16 GiB, like the t3.xlarge on AWS, at about the same price) with Ubuntu 24.04, a 64 GiB Premium SSD and a static IP. Its firewall opens **only SSH, only to your IP**. Then it runs the same [`deploy/provision.sh`](deploy/provision.sh) and opens the office through an SSH tunnel at http://localhost:4600. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.**

Every command from the AWS script works the same, with `deploy/azure.sh` in its place: `open`, `status`, `logs`, `ssh`, `update`, `invite`, `allow`, `service`, `resize Standard_D8as_v5`, `pause` (deallocates the VM, so only the disk and IP are billed), `resume` and `destroy` (deletes the resource group). One more, `connect`, lets a second computer manage the office. `--location` picks the region (default: your `az` default location, else `eastus`), `--subscription` the subscription and `--size` the VM size. The details are in [docs/azure.md](docs/azure.md).

## Deploy to Railway

No machine to look after: one script, using the Railway CLI. You need the **Railway CLI 5 or newer, logged in** (`railway login`), `ssh`, `curl`, Node.js and a clone of this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
deploy/railway.sh up --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

In about five minutes, `up`:

1. Creates a Railway project with one service, built from this checkout with [`deploy/container/Dockerfile`](deploy/container/Dockerfile): Node 22, git, the GitHub CLI and sshd, with Claude Code installed on first start.
2. Adds a **volume on `/data`** for everything the office keeps: the password, accounts, floors and settings, the projects, Claude's and GitHub's sign-ins, teammates' keys and the SSH host key. Restarts and redeploys replace the container, never the volume.
3. Puts Railway's **TCP proxy** in front of the container's SSH, and nothing else. The office listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` inside the container and has no public URL: everyone reaches it through an SSH tunnel, as on AWS.
4. Opens a tunnel and your browser at http://localhost:4600. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.**

The agents and GitHub sign in as on AWS: `--claude-token`, `--anthropic-api-key`, `--github-token` or `--no-github-token`.

```bash
deploy/railway.sh open              # tunnel + open the office (Ctrl-C closes the tunnel)
deploy/railway.sh status            # deployment, SSH address, volume, is the office up, who's invited
deploy/railway.sh invite octocat    # let a teammate tunnel in with their GitHub SSH keys
deploy/railway.sh logs              # follow the office's logs (ssh: a shell in the container)
deploy/railway.sh update            # build this checkout again and redeploy it
deploy/railway.sh destroy           # delete the project and its volume (asks first)
```

The details, and what's on the volume, are in [docs/railway.md](docs/railway.md).

## Deploy to Fly.io

The same container on a [Fly.io](https://fly.io) machine, using flyctl. You need **flyctl logged in** (`fly auth login`), `ssh`, `curl`, Node.js and a clone of this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
deploy/fly.sh up --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

In a few minutes, `up`:

1. Creates a Fly app with one machine, a `shared-cpu-4x` with 8 GB in the region nearest you, built from this checkout with the same [`deploy/container/Dockerfile`](deploy/container/Dockerfile) as on Railway.
2. Adds a **volume on `/data`** for everything the office keeps, so restarts, redeploys and resizes lose none of it.
3. Gives the app a **dedicated IPv4 address** with SSH on a random port, and nothing else. The office listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` inside the machine and has no public URL: everyone reaches it through an SSH tunnel, as on AWS.
4. Opens a tunnel and your browser at http://localhost:4600. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.**

The agents and GitHub sign in as on AWS: `--claude-token`, `--anthropic-api-key`, `--github-token` or `--no-github-token`.

```bash
deploy/fly.sh open                    # tunnel + open the office (Ctrl-C closes the tunnel)
deploy/fly.sh status                  # machine, SSH address, volume, is the office up, who's invited
deploy/fly.sh invite octocat          # let a teammate tunnel in with their GitHub SSH keys
deploy/fly.sh logs                    # follow the office's logs (ssh: a shell in the machine)
deploy/fly.sh update                  # build this checkout again and redeploy it
deploy/fly.sh resize performance-2x   # another machine size, same address and volume
deploy/fly.sh pause                   # stop the machine (resume starts it again)
deploy/fly.sh destroy                 # delete the app and its volume (asks first)
```

`--region`, `--org`, `--vm-size`, `--memory`, `--disk` and `--name` (for several offices) are in `deploy/fly.sh help`. The details, and what's on the volume, are in [docs/fly.md](docs/fly.md).

## Deploy to Dokploy

Already run a [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com) server? One script puts the office on it, through Dokploy's API. You need an **API key** (Dokploy: **Settings → Profile → API/CLI Keys**, with rate limiting off), `ssh`, `curl`, `git`, Node.js and a clone of this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
export DOKPLOY_API_KEY=<your key>
deploy/dokploy.sh up --url https://dokploy.example.com --claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"
```

In about five minutes, `up`:

1. Creates a Dokploy project with one application, and uploads this checkout for Dokploy to build with [`deploy/container/Dockerfile`](deploy/container/Dockerfile), the same image as on Railway.
2. Mounts a **Docker volume on `/data`** for everything the office keeps. Deploys and restarts replace the container, never the volume.
3. Publishes the container's SSH on **port 2222 of the server** (`--ssh-port` picks another), and nothing else: no domain, and the office listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` inside the container. Everyone reaches it through an SSH tunnel, as on AWS. A firewall in front of the server has to let that port through.
4. Opens a tunnel and your browser at http://localhost:4600. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.**

The agents and GitHub sign in as on AWS: `--claude-token`, `--anthropic-api-key`, `--github-token` or `--no-github-token`. `--server <name>` runs it on one of Dokploy's remote servers.

```bash
deploy/dokploy.sh open              # tunnel + open the office (Ctrl-C closes the tunnel)
deploy/dokploy.sh status            # its page in Dokploy, last deployment, SSH address, who's invited
deploy/dokploy.sh invite octocat    # let a teammate tunnel in with their GitHub SSH keys
deploy/dokploy.sh logs              # follow the office's logs (ssh: a shell in the container)
deploy/dokploy.sh update            # upload this checkout again, build it and redeploy it
deploy/dokploy.sh destroy           # delete the application and its volume (asks first)
```

The details, and what's on the volume, are in [docs/dokploy.md](docs/dokploy.md).

## Deploy to any Ubuntu or Debian server

Another cloud, or your own machine? Run one line on the server, as root or as a user with sudo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office/main/deploy/provision.sh | bash
```

It installs Node 22, git, the GitHub CLI, Claude Code and the office as a systemd service. Run as root, it creates an `agentoffice` user to run the office, so workers never run as root. The office listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` only, and the script ends by printing the SSH tunnel command and a link that shows the office password once. Run the same line again to update.

For HTTPS on your own domain, point a DNS record at the server and add `bash -s -- --domain office.example.com`: it sets up Caddy, which gets the certificate by itself. To put it on your Tailscale network instead, add `bash -s -- --tailscale`. The details, and setting it up by hand behind Caddy or nginx, are in [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md).

## Add users

Everyone gets their own account, so their name is on their character, in chat and on every terminal they type into.

**1. On a server, let them in first.** On a [Tailscale](docs/aws.md#tailscale) office, everyone on your tailnet can already open it. For someone who isn't, share the machine with them from Tailscale's Machines page: **☰ → 👥 Invite teammates** says how. Skip to step 2.

Otherwise the office is only reachable through an SSH tunnel, so a teammate needs their SSH key on the machine. In the office, open **☰ → 👥 Invite teammates** and type their GitHub username. On AWS, Railway, Fly.io or Dokploy you can also do it from your terminal:

```bash
deploy/aws.sh invite octocat        # installs the keys from github.com/octocat.keys
deploy/aws.sh allow 203.0.113.7     # their IP ("allow anywhere" opens SSH to every IP)
deploy/railway.sh invite octocat    # on Railway, SSH answers every IP already
deploy/fly.sh invite octocat        # and on Fly.io
deploy/dokploy.sh invite octocat    # and on Dokploy
```

It prints the command to send them. They leave it running and open http://localhost:4600:

```
ssh -L 4600:localhost:4600 office@<your-office-ip>
```

(On Railway and Fly.io the address carries a port of its own, like `ssh://office@zephyr.proxy.rlwy.net:17738`. On Dokploy it's the server's SSH port for the office: `ssh://office@203.0.113.7:2222`.)

Their key logs in as a locked-down `office` user that can only forward to the office port: no shell, no other ports. Running the office on your own computer, or on your own domain over HTTPS? Skip this step.

**2. Make them an account.** Open **☰ → 🔑 Accounts** and make an invite link. Name it (or let them pick) and make them a *Member* or an *Admin*. The link works once, for 7 days, and they choose their own password. Make one for yourself too, as an admin.

The same works from a terminal on the office's machine, even while it runs:

```bash
agent-office accounts                      # accounts and open invites
agent-office accounts invite ada --admin   # prints a single-use /join#… link
agent-office accounts role ada member
agent-office accounts revoke ada           # signed out within seconds
```

On the EC2 machine, run it through `deploy/aws.sh ssh` (on Azure, `deploy/azure.sh ssh`):

```bash
deploy/aws.sh ssh 'node /opt/agent-office/bin/agent-office.js accounts invite ada --dir "$(cat /etc/agent-office/home)"'
deploy/railway.sh ssh 'node /opt/agent-office/bin/agent-office.js accounts invite ada'   # on Railway
deploy/fly.sh ssh 'node /opt/agent-office/bin/agent-office.js accounts invite ada'       # on Fly.io
deploy/dokploy.sh ssh 'node /opt/agent-office/bin/agent-office.js accounts invite ada'   # on Dokploy
```

**Their own Claude and GitHub.** With accounts, everyone's workers run on their own Claude plan, and the office acts on GitHub as them: comments, merges, labels, pushes and pull requests show up under their name. The first time someone comes in, **🔐 Your sign-ins** opens (it's in the **☰** menu too). *Sign in with Claude* gives them Claude's sign-in page and takes back the code it shows. *Sign in with GitHub* shows a one-time code for github.com/login/device. They can paste a token from `claude setup-token`, or a GitHub token, instead. A 🐚 shell they open at a desk runs as them, so `claude auth login` and `gh auth login` typed there work too. Admins can use the office machine's own sign-ins instead. Each account's sign-ins live in `.agent-office/homes/<account>/`, and revoking the account deletes them. The boards are read with the machine's own `gh`, so that account needs read access to the repos. Running it just for yourself, with no accounts, none of this applies.

**3. Turn off the shared password.** Until you do, anyone who knows the office password can get in, as an admin. Once everyone has an account, switch it off in **🔑 Accounts** (signed in with your own admin account), or `agent-office accounts password off`.

**Removing someone.** Revoke their account in **🔑 Accounts** (or `agent-office accounts revoke <name>`), and on a server also remove them in **👥 Invite teammates** (on AWS, `deploy/aws.sh uninvite <name>`; on Railway, `deploy/railway.sh uninvite <name>`; on Fly.io, `deploy/fly.sh uninvite <name>`; on Dokploy, `deploy/dokploy.sh uninvite <name>`) to take away their SSH keys and drop open tunnels (other teammates just reconnect). If the shared password is still on, change it with `deploy/aws.sh reset-password` (or `deploy/railway.sh reset-password`, `deploy/fly.sh reset-password` or `deploy/dokploy.sh reset-password`).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite with hot reload on :5173, the server on :4600 (password: dev)
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Server edits restart the server, not the workers. After changing `ptyhost.ts`, bump `PTY_PROTOCOL` in `ptys.ts` so the next server replaces the PTY host.

Every change to the app that lands on `main` is published as a GitHub release by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), and `install.sh` installs the newest one. Bump `package.json`'s version to start a new minor.

With Easy approvals enabled, automatic permission review stays in the working state until a human prompt is confirmed or the review remains unresolved for 10 seconds, avoiding transient help notifications. See [the easy approvals lever](docs/features.md).

The Maintenance counter opens an **engineering workspace** by default: **Conversation**, **Work & issues**, and **Review & checks**, with the live agent console alongside them. Questions, permission prompts and errors appear in the actual console, with keyboard controls and an answer box; a visible blocker calls out when Maintenance needs you. Paste, drop or attach screenshots (up to four PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF images, 10 MB each), and keep drafts and a searchable shared conversation archive. Tell Maintenance what to capture or queue in Conversation: it creates linked GitHub issues using its backlog tool. Work & issues and the wall board show the same GitHub lifecycle; the **maintenance:queued** label is the shared queue. GitHub title, label and closed-state changes appear in both views after refresh. **+ Add issue** uses `gpt-6-luna` through the signed-in Codex CLI to read the office source in a read-only, ephemeral session and craft a descriptive, technical issue from your title and context. Failed drafting keeps your form draft and creates no issue. Use **Start next queued issue** when Maintenance is free; queued work waits for you. Each issue starts a fresh session, shares the stack, and links its conversation, screenshots and new commits for review. Inspect working edits and commit diffs, request corrections, and run typecheck/tests/build in the Maintenance worktree without shipping. The big button still ships the whole stack. **Settings → Maintenance** retains the legacy interface; existing browser settings are promoted to the workspace once, then explicit legacy choices are respected. See [Maintenance workspace](docs/features.md#maintenance-engineering-workspace).

Workers can present big, completed changes on the lounge TV's **Demos** channel. Use the remote on the coffee table (or the TV) to browse the persistent demo archive or switch to screen sharing. Search its sidebar, open source PR/issue links, reload a demo, or expand just the HTML artifact to fullscreen (Esc returns to the archive). Demos use HTML, CSS and optional JavaScript, including inline bundled libraries; JSON is only the publishing envelope. See [TV demos](docs/features.md#tv-demos).

The maintenance closet has a post-it issues board on the wall behind Maintenance, labelled **Agent Office · Issues**. It reads the GitHub repository on the office source checkout’s `origin` remote (`AGENT_OFFICE_SOURCE`, or the install checkout), so forks show their own issues rather than upstream, independently of the project floor; the Kanban names the repository. Hover (or aim at) a note to see its issue title; click it or press **E** to read the issue. Click bare cork to open the Agent Office issue Kanban. **Move to In progress & start Maintenance** sends the open issue’s title, URL and description directly to the shared Maintenance agent and assigns it to your GitHub account (or the office account), moving it to In progress and removing its queue label. Assignment failures are reported; they do not cancel the accepted request. **Ask Maintenance about this** opens a request you can edit instead. These actions use Maintenance rather than the project queue. Starting an issue refreshes the GitHub board first; lookup and assignment explicitly select the office source’s origin repository, including in forks with an upstream remote. The main-room board still lets you pick up and carry cards.

At the Maintenance kiosk, **E** opens the review controls: read a stacked commit and its diff, **Correct this change** or **Request / correct** to send a follow-up, and **Watch / answer in terminal** to inspect the session or answer a permission prompt. Terminal access takes you to the agent’s floor if needed; corrections always reach the one existing Maintenance session. Nothing ships until you press the stack’s ship button.
