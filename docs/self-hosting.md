# Self-hosting on your own server

Back to the [README](../README.md).

The simplest private setup needs no certificates at all. Run `agent-office --host 127.0.0.1` and have everyone connect with `ssh -L 4600:localhost:4600 you@server`, then open http://localhost:4600. Browsers treat `localhost` as secure, so voice and screen sharing work.

To serve it on a real domain instead, put the office behind HTTPS. Voice and screen sharing need a secure context. The simplest setup is Caddy, which gets certificates automatically:

```caddy
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
office.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4600
}
```

```bash
cd /srv/my-project
agent-office --host 127.0.0.1 --trust-proxy --password "$(openssl rand -base64 18)"
```

Caddy proxies WebSockets out of the box. With nginx, forward the Host and Upgrade headers:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4600;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 1d;
}
```

To keep the office running, use a systemd unit:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/agent-office.service
[Unit]
Description=Agent Office
After=network.target

[Service]
User=dev
WorkingDirectory=/srv/my-project
# generate with: openssl rand -base64 24
Environment=AGENT_OFFICE_PASSWORD=<a long random password>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env agent-office --host 127.0.0.1 --trust-proxy
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you don't have a domain, `--self-signed` serves HTTPS directly. Browsers will warn once per person.

**Voice across strict NATs.** Peers connect directly using public STUN. If some teammates can't hear each other (common on corporate networks), run a TURN server such as coturn and pass `--turn turn:user:pass@turn.example.com:3478`.
