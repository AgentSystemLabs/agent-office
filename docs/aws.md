# AWS reference

The full story behind `deploy/aws.sh`. The short version is in the [README](../README.md#deploy-to-aws-ec2).

If you have the AWS CLI logged in, one command gives you your own office on EC2. No Terraform needed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSystemLabs/agent-office && cd agent-office
deploy/aws.sh up
```

After that, the whole lifecycle is four more commands:

```bash
deploy/aws.sh open      # tunnel to the office and open it in your browser
deploy/aws.sh pause     # stop the machine to save money (asks first); only the disk and IP are billed
deploy/aws.sh resume    # start it again: same address, same files, then open it
deploy/aws.sh destroy   # delete the machine, disk, IP, security group and key pair (asks first)
```

What `up` does, in about 2 minutes:

1. Creates an SSH key pair (kept in `~/.config/agent-office/aws/<name>/`).
2. Creates a security group that opens **only SSH (port 22), and only to your current IP**. The office itself is never on the internet.
3. Gives the machine a fixed Elastic IP and launches a **t3.xlarge** (4 vCPU, 16 GiB) Ubuntu 24.04 instance with a 50 GiB disk.
4. Runs the same [`deploy/provision.sh`](../deploy/provision.sh) as [any server](self-hosting.md): it installs Node 22, git, the GitHub CLI and **Claude Code**, clones the latest agent-office from GitHub and runs `npm i`. The office keeps its data in `~/agent-office` on the machine and clones projects into `~/workspace/<owner>/<repo>`.
5. Runs the office under systemd with `Restart=always`, so it comes back after a crash or a reboot, and `KillMode=process`, so restarting it leaves the workers running. It listens on `127.0.0.1:4600` on the machine, so the only way in is an SSH tunnel.
6. Opens an SSH tunnel and your browser at `http://localhost:4600`. **The first page shows the office password once. Write it down.** The server then keeps only a hash, so nobody can display the password again.
7. The office opens on its elevator with no floors yet. It lists every repository your GitHub token can see: pick one and it becomes the first floor.

Everything goes through SSH, so there are no certificate warnings, and `localhost` counts as a secure origin: voice and screen sharing just work. Keep the terminal open while you use the office; Ctrl-C closes the tunnel. Next time, run `deploy/aws.sh open`. If port 4600 is taken on your machine, it picks the next free one.

**Inviting your team.** Teammates don't need AWS access or this repo, just `ssh`. In the office, click **👥 Invite teammates** in the **☰** menu and type their GitHub username. That installs the SSH keys from `github.com/<username>.keys`. The panel then gives you one command to send them, for macOS, Linux or Windows. It opens the tunnel and, once it's up, the office in their browser:

```
ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -o PermitLocalCommand=yes -o LocalCommand="open http://localhost:4600" -L 4600:localhost:4600 office@<your-office-ip>
```

**Copy invite message** copies the command, plus the server fingerprint to check on first connect. The panel also lists who's invited and can remove them. The same works from your terminal:

```bash
deploy/aws.sh invite octocat        # uses the SSH keys on github.com/octocat
deploy/aws.sh allow 203.0.113.7     # their IP (SSH answers only allowed IPs)
```

They leave that command running and sign in with the office password. Their keys log in as a separate `office` user that can **only** forward to the office port. It has no shell, no other ports, no `-R`, and no agent forwarding. So a leaked teammate key still doesn't get past the office password.

**Reviewing what workers build.** Every web server a worker runs is listed on the **🌐 Services** board. Clicking a row copies a command like this one:

```
ssh -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -o PermitLocalCommand=yes -o LocalCommand="open http://localhost:5173" -L 5173:localhost:4600 office@<your-office-ip>
```

It opens http://localhost:5173 on their computer. The tunnel ends at the office's own port, and the office relays it to the worker's server on 5173. So the same invited keys work, nothing new is opened on the machine, and every page still asks for the office password (anyone signed in to the office already is). Keep one terminal per service open while you look. You set the office up yourself? Run `deploy/aws.sh service 5173` instead.

If chasing teammates' IPs gets old, `deploy/aws.sh allow anywhere` opens SSH to every IP. That's a reasonable trade: SSH only accepts your key and invited keys, and the office stays behind the tunnel.

```bash
deploy/aws.sh open                 # tunnel + open the office in your browser
deploy/aws.sh service 5173         # open a worker's web server from the 🌐 Services board
deploy/aws.sh invite <gh-user>     # let a teammate tunnel in (or: invite <name> <key.pub>)
deploy/aws.sh uninvite <name>      # remove their keys and drop open tunnels
deploy/aws.sh team                 # who's invited
deploy/aws.sh allow 203.0.113.7    # let an IP reach SSH (CIDR ok; "me", "anywhere")
deploy/aws.sh revoke 203.0.113.7   # …and take it back
deploy/aws.sh status               # instance, address, office up?, team, allowed IPs
deploy/aws.sh resize t3.2xlarge    # bigger or smaller machine; same address, ~1-2 min of downtime
deploy/aws.sh update               # install the latest agent-office and restart
deploy/aws.sh reset-password       # new password, shown once; signs everyone out
deploy/aws.sh ssh | logs           # get on the box / follow the office logs
```

**Upgrading from the office.** **⬆️ Upgrade the office** in the **☰** menu checks GitHub for new commits on the branch the office was installed from. When there are any, an orange **⬆️ Update** button shows up on the top bar, and it lists them. **Upgrade now** builds the new version next to the running one. Meanwhile the office keeps working and everyone sees a banner. A failed build changes nothing. Once the build succeeds, the office swaps it in and restarts, and everyone gets a *"🛠️ Upgrading the office"* dialog. A few seconds later their page reloads on the new version. Workers keep working through it: their terminals run in a process of their own, which the new version picks back up. (An office set up before this lets them keep running from its next upgrade on; the first one resumes them with *continue*.)

An office created before the SSH tunnel served HTTPS on port 443 with a self-signed certificate. Run `deploy/aws.sh up` once to move it over: 443 closes and the office moves behind the tunnel. Offices created before **👥 Invite teammates** and **⬆️ Upgrade the office** also need one `deploy/aws.sh up` before those show up in the **☰** menu. `update` alone isn't enough, because `up` installs the key helper and turns on self-upgrade in the systemd unit.

Useful options for `up`:

- `--project owner/repo` also clones that repo as the office's first floor. Without it, you pick projects in the elevator. (Before, the office was started in the GitHub origin of the directory you ran `up` from, which is usually agent-office itself. An office set up that way keeps its data in that checkout after `up`, and you can take agent-office off the building in the elevator.)
- `--instance-type`, `--disk` and `--region` set the machine size, disk size and region.
- `--allow <ip>` lets more IPs reach SSH from the start.
- `--name <name>` runs several offices side by side.

**Claude sign-in.** Workers run Claude Code on the machine, so it has to be signed in there. You can do this either way:

- Pass `--claude-token "$(claude setup-token)"`, which uses your Claude subscription, or `--anthropic-api-key <key>`.
- Do nothing, and the first worker jumps with *"Claude isn't signed in — type /login"*. Open its terminal and run `/login`.

**GitHub.** By default, your local `gh auth token` is used to sign in the GitHub CLI on the machine. It's needed for private repos, the issue and PR boards, and for workers to push branches and open PRs. Anyone who can use the office can use that token, so pass `--github-token <fine-grained token>` or `--no-github-token` if that's too much.
